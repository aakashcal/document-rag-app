Title: “The Town That Forgot Itself”

It was a small town, nestled deep between rolling green hills, and if you blinked while driving past it, you’d miss the only crooked sign that read: Welcome to Merrowood — Pop. ???. No one really knew the population. They said it changed daily. Not from people coming and going — just… changing.

There was no mayor, no school, and no real authority figure. Just a librarian named Miss Elspeth who remembered everyone’s secrets, and a grumpy man named Carl who ran the post office and insisted on calling every woman “Margaret,” whether her name was Mary, Alicia, or Angela.

The story begins on a morning like any other — overcast, quiet, the kind of chill that sneaks up your sleeves before you even realize it. A boy named Milo Aldridge woke up, rubbed his eyes, and forgot who he was. His mother, sitting at the breakfast table with a cigarette in one hand and a spoon of cereal in the other, didn’t seem surprised.

“Happens to everyone at some point,” she said calmly, blowing a smoke ring. “Want some cereal, or are you one of those yogurt people today?”

Milo blinked. “I… don’t know.”

“Well, the good news is,” she added, “you still know what cereal is. That’s something.”

The only clue Milo had to his identity was a note in his pocket that read: “Find the memory bell.” The handwriting was neat, but unfamiliar. Under it was a doodle of a bell inside a tree.

Merrowood, as odd as it was, wasn’t exactly a town for mysteries. People forgot things, yes — but they always came back eventually. The locals just learned to roll with it. The barista at Brew & Chew might greet you with, “Hey, you’re the guy who always orders cappuccino and leaves a book behind,” even if you didn’t remember liking coffee or reading.

But the note in Milo’s pocket felt serious. Urgent.

So, with a crust of toast in his mouth and a blue hoodie that might or might not have been his, he stepped outside.

Chapter 2: The Man Who Claimed the Sky

Merrowood had its legends. The oldest one was about a man who painted the sky. Not in a poetic way — literally. They said in 1947, a painter named Jonas Trill climbed the highest peak and vanished into the clouds. Ever since, the sunsets over Merrowood looked like oil paintings, thick with reds and oranges too rich to be real.

At the bottom of Jonas Hill was a wooden sign that read, “Keep going. You’ll forget you’re tired.”

Milo wasn’t sure why he was drawn there, but something about the trees whispered in a language only his bones could understand. He passed by Old Mrs. Tellerman, who was watering plastic flowers in her yard.

“Looking for something, dear?” she chirped.

“Maybe.”

She smiled like she’d heard that answer a hundred times. “If you find a pair of dentures up there, they’re mine. Just toss them down.”

He waved and kept walking.

Halfway up, Milo saw someone ahead — an old man in a green vest, painting the trunk of a tree with invisible paint. The man turned, smiled
